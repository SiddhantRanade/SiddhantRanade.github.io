# About me

I am a first year PhD student in the [School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/) at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/).

My research focuses on Computer Vision, particularly scene reconstruction.

I earned my Bachelors degree from the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/), where I majored in Engineering Physics, with a minor in Computer Science.  At IITB, I worked with Prof. [Siddhartha Chaudhuri](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sidch/) on my Bachelors Thesis, titled Material Prediction for Untextured 3D Models from 2D Images.
