<!-- ## About Me -->

I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/">School of Computing</a> at the <a href="https://www.utah.edu/">University of Utah</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/~srikumar/">Prof. Srikumar Ramalingam</a>.

My research focuses on Computer Vision, particularly scene reconstruction.

I earned my Bachelor's degree from the <a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Bombay</a>, where I majored in Engineering Physics, with a minor in Computer Science.  At IITB, I worked with Prof. <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sidch/">Siddhartha Chaudhuri</a> on my Bachelor's Thesis titled Material Prediction for Untextured 3D Models from 2D Images.
